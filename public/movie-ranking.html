<h1>The Best Movies According to Alex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time (so far):</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</h3>
<p>This isn't a movie for everyone, but if you are into retro gaming and enjoy 
2000's parody type comedy, this movie will become a favorite.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Cinema at it's best. One of the movies of all time.</p>
<h3>The Hateful Eight</h3>
<p>The plot in this one will keep you guessing until the very end.</p>
